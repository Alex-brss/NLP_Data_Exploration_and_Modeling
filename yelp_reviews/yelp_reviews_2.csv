I would recommend to everyone who comes here. If your looking for an entertainment place for your weekend go now. My boyfriend and I were getting into a house in a couple of minutes drive. He lived so far down the street that we were probably late. I was looking for a place of the night to grab drinks because it was a nice place to meet people, relax, play games, and hang out.

We are always back at the rooftop where the main event is.

I am just tired then. I had plenty of other things planned for the day but we just ended up just hanging out there.

Food...",5,Los Angeles,"Came to Metroid for dinner with some of my friends. Everything was impeccable, from ambience, service, to the food quality. 

Ambience - smart casual 

Food... I've never had anything like it in my life.

Service - nice

Beverages... I tried out B2K1, and it tasted amazing as well. 

Overall my only disappointment is that I can't order any of those (that I ordered had no extra goodies), it really can't be trusted with such a simple meal at this scale.

This place is a little over the top of my list of great restaurants but for the price of $15. I would go anywhere else as long as you will make it on time.

Excellent food, great service, and I am just glad I came here for pizza and pizzazz. I had a good meal, and I would recommend this place as well. It is very trendy, and everything we ordered from it was fabulous. I","Came to Metroid for dinner with some of my friends. Everything was impeccable, from ambience, service, to the food quality.

So glad my dog had a chance to join us for dinner and I have to say it is worth the wait in this restaurant. I ordered the meatballs as their burger was way too pricey but was rather happy for them it was worth the wait.

I love dining here - it's like you're in the middle of a family dinner with me! There's a large rooftop pool on the deck with nice views over the ocean! I highly recommend. I will check into another once we eat here.

My brother loves our food; he's into ice cream and eggs, but the ice cream has really left him hungry for hours. I had a good time at this bar, so good that I'll definitely come back, but will it ever be that big for him if things stay that way?

A great place to hang out after dinner as well. The place has small tables and is also small enough to have the bar with you for a beer and wine (assuming you have a bartender there). But we didn't think it would be that much since we didn't get an option, so it was worth taking. We are coming here for a Friday evening and I highly recommend their selection of wines - just bring one with you. The menu (all the usual stuff) is quite good though it is not as high end as others on this list. The location is good, but it wasn't an option for us so we wanted to stay back for the Sunday or Friday night. We will definitely return (if we decide to go to the bar one day soon but not yet)

It was really nice feeling fresh (I am sure you were). We had lunch here on time, when we didn't eat for several minutes and had to finish a special treat. However, this place was quite the contrast between a good food & some bad food and we should probably take a bit longer!

Best steak I have ever had. I ordered the steak for my daughter as it had the ""taste of beef on toast"" on it. I also ordered the salad, a side of fish taco. Our group had both sides so I was happy and satisfied with the salad. Overall, great food!

I used this recipe for rice. I added the following as a reminder: I made this with 5 large tofu stir fry truffles, an order of 6.5, a large cup of water, half a pot of water and a handful of green chili bean chutney. I also added a few tablespoons for garnishing. I was a little worried about how long it would cook after cooking, but I took it in to the end of the day (and it ended up being about 6-8 minutes). I'm going to add this again in the future to avoid getting burned. However, I don't do this every year or two and it does work out well."" Read more

I was really surprised. I made the mistake of eating this at McDonald's. I got the ""spicy but perfectly balanced"" dish, and the flavors and taste were all just right. So, I am not a huge fan of McDonald's at home. But, this was a great way to enjoy your meals. I did agree it was a little too much garlic-y cheese for my liking.. Read more

This is the only vegetarian tasting menu I know of in Los Angeles with seafood & meat...and my family was totally surprised how well these were balanced. The prices were not bad for the fish. We had about 1,000 fish (and 1,100 more for our soup to get ready for lunch) and they were good. I'm definitely coming back for these!

It wasn't that I didn't come here before but I came here during the week but it seems like most places have different options for seafood options but unfortunately I think it was the food. The menu consisted of 2 to 3 dishes per lunch - something like a dinner, but with food you could put on a salad or you could put on a salad bar. All of the dishes were cooked beautifully with a good smothered side of green salad. You could make a batch in the pot if you were on a budget or you could eat the whole dish","I was surprised and delighted to see that Le Comptoir was back!

A nice service with decent reviews on Facebook. The person that delivered you a bowl has a lot of knowledge of the food we ordered so it can be an easy way to buy what you want. You also get the chance for a menu. The menu is laid out in great detail and all its a must for a diner.

So, no question, if you're a diner and don't go to The Market often, you'll probably need an internet connection. But there's nothing wrong with that. We're pretty much on our absolute limit in this service at the whole chain. We ordered some of our own and were so very impressed.

Tentatively clean, so I went there for lunch and nothing was left there on the counter. The waiter was a bit worried though as even after we started we'd still be out of drinks. I also ordered my food and it was tasty. So thank you Nour! Thank you!!

My family loves this place. The food was excellent and they had the most unique cuisine of everything else. The staff were extremely good! We ordered the hot salmon and bacon salad, the grilled onion soup and the sweet potato salad. We ordered a side of pickles and they taste awesome! They also had some really sweet potatoes with garlic for extra crunch. We will come back for more chicken but I have not had this much of a meal with this place. The service was very courteous.

It was quite early enough to have a little bit more time than we would like to, but things were going to just go sideways and we would still end up having to make some more decisions. They came with a lot of things you don't see in the game, and the time period in which we were having to figure out how to do it was more than disappointing. But I guess I'll say the more people who read it the better I think the game will be and, of course, because that is what people are reading and that is what we're planning on doing.

Chef's choice of seafood is something we have had for years and we know how much delicious seafood is to come! When they first laid eyes on us in the mid '80s we were just like we were being watched. The quality of seafood served up by our own chefs was beyond any other cuisine that we had ever eaten at. Our favorite is the fish and seafood combination, with shrimp, salmon, or salmon in turn covered with sea cucumber. They are the most versatile and best option that we had with all of our seafood. What's better is that with our family of fishermen we are in the same boat as their fish and fish recipes and are constantly making new additions to our diet, all while taking advantage of our family's generous access to resources and resources. We are happy we can't wait to try their place next time...

We went to this in 2008. First we came up to the front with the name of the place in our heads. Everyone told us the name was something about it being located next to one which they knew was actually a bar. However, the actual name was actually on their side of the building, which means we took the wrong side of the building, into a different building.

Highly recommend when visiting. Chill music and good live music on Friday nights, Saturday mornings.
Best food: I do occasionally eat a lot of burgers there. So I give this place some credit as well.
Cocktails and wine: Great selection of Irish pub beers, I recommend trying them out. It's probably more good pub beers. Very friendly patrons!
Best drinks: I highly recommend Barrington (you can hear it in the movie scene) and I really recommend it.
No frills but is well made and packed with good drinks in an appealing restaurant

From KU, this local food court is a favorite in Silver Lake. In fact, its best seller is an excellent bag of chicken or salad. A huge bonus, you save 25 percent on just about anything in it — just head to its flagship location across the street from Silver Lake City Hall.

6. Blackout Lounge

In part because the bar is the go-to for all things American, this upscale spot can be a hit with casual fans. It's not for everyone — be aware that there are about 2.4 million of them. But if you're looking for something in the dark, Blackout is the spot to go.

Had to come to an event or if I am in a hurry will come back for more!!! I love this restaurant. I had the Chicken Quiche which is a big cheese bread with a deep and generous fried crust. It was great that my friend is from South Australia. He was delicious! My wife is from Australia and she is always friendly

This is one of my top favorite joints in Australia, especially among the locals. We love the food and the service, as mentioned above is great! The wine list is wonderful and the service is superb. This will certainly be back. I was shocked to find out that it was a menu and we were actually told that it was just an order at that time. There is also this place which is now closed for good reason and still"

LOVED how easy to make each bite. I didn't prepare much to compare, but I made sure to stick to my usual sweet and sour bites, especially the caramel and maple. I was happy I did. Next time I'll make another change to try this, but it was easy! I ended up making the change to omit the maple for... Read more

I had the black truffle fettuccine, eggs appetizer, burrata and the shrimp. This definitely wasn't a bad meal, it was very good and filled us all at once. The wine selection was excellent and they even have the best wine selection in the entire place. The only mistake that was made was the price of their wine was a bit low. If you are not used to paying any more than an 18 cent a glass, I would have paid as much as 18 dollars but they decided to take it down to 2$ less. When I came here last winter, I saw them give the red wine, I was just glad that they don't give that type of wine out of convenience anymore. They were nice. And also, they opened up the bar so everyone could order their wine. I could go watch a show. Not so when a restaurant with lots of seating and great food is closed on a Sunday.

We made this for my husband and loved it. We were impressed with our experience and we always get compliments. The best part? We really didn't give up our date and took our baby's date and we had this place to keep everyone company. This has given us so much more time to spend together and had me making some of my own cakes for our family on our last night alone. I would recommend this place for everyone.","Came here for brunch.

Great idea, but it couldn't be a better idea. The only problem for me is that while it comes with a full coffee set you can have other sets too.  Even then if you were ordering a cup we don't think it would be as amazing as this is. 


I do not like coffee in Europe so I started with the good stuff, I will also give this a 10.  I only have two versions of this in my own home but I love it. Also, if you find anything out of character here is where i would like to go.


A good and affordable option if you love the cafe you just can't beat it! I've found it as I've been a coffee lover for 13 years. This is very good, fast, and free.

Namaste: ""Namaste"" is the Japanese term for Japanese cuisine, traditionally considered a ""good"" dish, similar in origin to a steak or a salad.

The Japanese cuisine focuses on rice, chicken, red bean, and pork in contrast to the western style of cooking with rice and other meats, making a large difference in the food's flavour profile.

A good choice from the list of options is a combination of spicy and salty dishes, with a light mix of flavors and textures at your disposal.

A good vegetarian or vegan approach to cuisine is to go for a vegetarian option, but vegetarian food is always more palatable than vegan, because it gives the same nutritional benefits the traditional diets do: a balanced diet.

Really, an amazing place to see a romantic dance. There's a large selection of local music and the restaurant menu is quite extensive. I'm usually a huge fan of local music, usually at night, especially the Sizzling Blue Lips & Pink Floyd, etc.

This place has quite a good reputation and a really interesting dancer named Elle. Their atmosphere is a bit old fashioned. I like the fact that they have a small bar area and that the dance floor is small. As a huge fan of La La Land she actually had two dances with them at one corner. She only danced from where she could and that's an unusual choice for her.

For the food and drinks the staff is top of their game. Nice staff, great place to have a good time. This is a one-of-a-kind event and we were really hoping to watch some of it. We saw a lot of different people making their home beers at the bar with this one guy. He was looking for an excuse for a hot day of dancing or something. Our waitress was pretty nice and we agreed that this was my kind of place. It gets better as the food gets better and it becomes a little more informal. The atmosphere is very welcoming and fun.

My boyfriend and my sister have been living at the hostel for 4 days and we are all so thankful!! We want to keep coming back!! - November 19, 2010Very very fast service to get where in NYC We love the location."

Just as a bonus, they were very friendly. 

Great service. They were the first thing, and they were the first person to ask about the food! Also got the food out of a small box I opened (I had a box of ice cream in one of the tables!). They had 2 large cakes on the table and a cake out on top (the second was a cupcake, which was $6 and included some goodies along with the drink-a-half). 

I'm so happy with the selection of desserts and food. The desserts in the restaurant were awesome! They have a huge variety and I got some from them from the last dinner. They were so sweet and flavorful and everyone","Made a reservation on Christmas Day around 11 AM for 9 PM.

The pre-fix...

First of all...I had a great time here today. The atmosphere was great!

The burger is really good! Very flavorful. The cilantro and cheese taste so good! I ordered one, and it was good too. It goes well with chicken wings.

My boyfriend and I had a perfect date. The party lasted almost a week. He told me the best experience he's had to date. Thanks!

I know I was expecting a burger but I really liked the hot, warm flavors of the lettuce & tomato. The fries were good and I have always ordered a few to order. I had the same combo and liked the cheese. The only thing that will hurt, is the price. If you order a burger the price will increase to $15 so it will get away","We came for Thanksgiving at 8 PM.

We only got drinks, my drink The Cluny was very good, yummy and refreshing. The ones my friends have... I wish they had a little more flavor, like the '50s, for good measure.
I think it would be better to stick with some vodka.
This place is legit, but at $15, it's definitely worth a try on your own if you are looking for something more than a classic of cocktails. What a great place to catch up on stuff that has just gotten out of hand but not really needed to be, like the hot dog place in the background.
So much for having so much booze, which you should consider drinking.

Excellent service! We ordered the ""poutine"" of a different kind, they were quite good. I can't wait for this place to start serving poutine again. It's been quite a year since last order.

Not a great sandwich, I think we should try this and eat it again

What is this company?

Serves about 4 so I'd recommend coming here to try it out. Our waitress said that she'd be coming back soon after we return, so I had to come back to the menu. Not a bad sandwich, but not by far. The meat is too high in fat to be able to keep the same quantity that it would normally be in. The bun is not too big, but it just doesn't look great. It smells too acidic and you have to dig for it as it comes off quickly.

We had the option of ordering some pizza. This place had a large counter with various pies, but it was just too much for me. The music by Keith ""Kenny"" Harris was awesome, especially the bass player, Jim Johnson. Our waiter went to the end to start his list up, so he kept the first 10 or 12 names out of it.

The ""guess the wine get the bottle"" is near impossible but...I will definitely not order this again.

A great value, but it's an off-menu food. I think we are going to give it 4 stars - not really. We were seated right by the dining area, with food coming out of the door. We ordered the Chicken Pot Pie, which was very salty and sweet. It was tasty, but then was not appetizing and was pretty hard to understand. The only bad thing I could think of was the amount of meat and eggs I could eat. That's probably due to them missing half their portion due to the amount of meat, eggs and chicken. Our waitress said if we order it with the chicken (it would still be delicious), it will be good. We asked to eat and it wasn't.

I found the sauce just right for this dish we had on a trip with the kids and we only cooked it because it was so nice! We cooked it while the kids were busy and it really took the kids off course. I really liked how it took it into our little Italian restaurant and ate on their second try but it didn't do it justice. When cooking I thought it was too much. I will probably leave it at that but I'm still a little disappointed. However, the pasta with the garlic is great so if you haven't used it before this could be more appealing.

This was not a well made bag and they did not know what they were doing to it. I did buy two bags and thought they were good. But they didn't take care of other bags. The smell and smell that the dry bag carried was bad, so I did not use it again. The leather bag is good but they did not realize what that bag was or what was going on.

Wife Loved her family so much! We were staying in the restaurant around 8:30pm with our daughter. We ordered the roast prawn soup with the mustard sauce on and it was delicious. It was only 2.25 oz of rice. The salad was amazing to say the least and we just wanted to get it with some cheese on it. The sauce is very mild and the noodles were tasty. The rice was very soft and fluffy on the outside. I will be returning back for more.

A great restaurant where we don't wait to order. A good selection of burgers, steak, lamb, and seafood.

...would be the start of my journey in the future.  But first, it would be the beginning of my journey in the life of Ai Fiori, and that, I didn't know.  But that, was the plan that I made","4.5 stars

From the polished service to the elegant dining room, to the delicious food, I have always loved Ai Fiori.  However, I had not been there in... a day.  Well, it had been a day for me to return for the next three days, and I was hoping that it would be a good one. But that happened.  I didn't know to which day. So I made up my mind. So, the day that was to follow the last day of playing.  I could not wait for tomorrow....

Each course was delicious and we had some...I'd imagine that was the reason for the menu. Not exactly what I have come to expect from this location, but it's still one of our favorite eateries in Austin.

We loved getting to share the chef's house with the family and friends. I'm sure we'd enjoy it for breakfast and dessert if you were in to our area. We came over for dinner before the bar started to get busy. I will definitely try out the place again!

Curious as to where this place is located, I was able to find it on I-75, just off the bustling, downtown section of I-70. I'm fairly certain the food was there from the start but I definitely would not take my eyes off of the spot. I would not stop until I saw it. There was an incredible selection of meat, seafood, and local craft brew","We enjoyed a delicious meal here on Thanksgiving Day. The ambiance was inviting and our waiter was very friendly!

N.C.I.H.I has been doing a massive amount of publicity in its 20's and 90's because of all the great restaurants at Lucien. We finally got around to heading to Lucien to check it out since it was a first day at the venue so it's been quite an amazing experience in my opinion.

Excellent seafood and great service! We like to eat here as a family and they usually have the special shrimp tacos. It seemed like a must try so we went ahead with the shrimp.

No comment, I'm a modern American with a big heart.

I think this is a good location for a BBQ joint and a restaurant and I'm curious if there is a better mix of American and Canadian cuisine.

I've noticed you're not selling hot dogs here, so this sounds like it could work for a place that sells frozen foods.

I agree with all of those people that they are not as good as your new food place. But you may get great quality and good service here at MOMA.

Do you think you can actually get a local favorite in a place like MOMA? Or am I just out of my mind?

Lamb shank over at a bar. I loved seeing the chef work in a bar with a lot of staff at the bar so we brought in an old timey diner as her manager to serve a quick take out. Great place to try new brews, pick up a couple glasses of wine or just grab a quick glass yourself.

Delicious! This was great meal! I love the meat on top. You can grab a large quantity for $14.10 on its own, but for $18.10 for the meat that's more or less half way through.

There are no better meals in New York City. Fresh vegetables are always worth it with the homemade chicken and the hot meat. It's not just the meat, though. It's the beans, bread, lettuce and chicken.

The staff here are extremely nice! I went with both the veggie and chicken portions. I also had the rice vegetarian chicken instead of the mushroom portion.

Hooker's Wife! I really love this meal! I made a big mistake with my dinner. I made two batches and I could tell the food tasted OK. For me, everything was ok but I needed to replace the onion, so I kept adding garlic. I think they even had the ""mixed"" in salt. I made sure everyone was in the same room or on the same floor (because they had been on the same floor since late last night). The chicken was good too! But I think the flavor really stood out with the garlic and salt. The chicken flavor wasn't as pronounced but after all, I would never want a bad soup!

- Flowers! Dozens of beautiful, fresh bouquets filled the restaurant and made it smell... lovely. But I only had 4 people to take care of the flowers! I also had some leftover pasta from when the first salad was made.

- They were SO generous with their delicious sauce. They even gave their own sauce to the waiter to make. It makes you want to eat every meal but, since I'm also not vegan, I really preferred an egg. And their dessert? They even had me a banana with sugar cookies and their homemade chocolate pudding cake - everything for free and perfect for the brunch date.

- Great service, so happy I went to La Grenouille...

The restaurant is stunning...the only thing you can expect from Chef Flemming's restaurant for a breakfast table space.  The menus are simple enough that it is possible to order an appetizer.  I'd expect a few extra calories than your average food order, but it's a good price for what you get from the restaurant. We ordered a steak dinner.  The meat was super tasty, but not overpowering enough compared to my favorite steak dinner.

A great place for breakfast. We got the seafood pasta and the meat wasn't quite as hot as expected but it was cooked well enough to keep our order for the evening. I didn't need much sauce and the seafood pasta in question was quite good. The egg noodles served with the lamb and the veggies were well worth the price point. The fries and chicken meat also took their toll on the food. The only drawback is I was left","Rather disappointing.  We had dinner this past Saturday night.

It's a bit cold and is kinda hard to clean when there is the snow or the weather, in the winter it's not as cold. It's not so bad but I really would like it. It's a good meal to make and something I will definitely add. A really good price (it's low carb and everything I use) and the food is amazing. (If you want to go out, eat at 8AM for a meal, the rest is 2 hours. It is also worth asking a friend ""where is the other restaurant in the area?"".

My daughter","I've eaten at this restaurant since in opened on 14th street a millennium ago then again when it moved to 79th St.   I always liked it, but didn't remember... It's a bit cold and is kinda hard to clean when there is the snow or the weather, in the winter it's not as cold. It's not so bad but I really would like it. It's a good meal to make and something I will definitely add. A really good price (it's low carb and everything I use) and the food is amazing. (If you want to go out, eat at 8AM for a meal, the rest is 2 hours. It is also worth asking a friend ""where is the other restaurant in the area?"".

I came for restaurant week and met Chef Angie Mar which was thrilling in itself....it was one of the best restaurants I have ever had in LA and am highly recommend the food!!!

Dinner was pretty good...very food. Had good coffee, food trucks, hot dogs, food to go and other great food. I ordered a bottle of wine for $10 and a bottle of vodka for a bottle of liqueur and it was pretty tasty. If you want a fine dining experience (but they won't let you take pics or share with any friends who may be in LA), I would definitely consider these places a possibility if you want to try their food as far as what they offer. It came with some nice wine from a local bar and as a bonus I could check my Instagram to see if I had my bottle of wine, but unfortunately, it didn't work out!

Al, you are going to be back early tomorrow."" I immediately pulled up onto the street (there were several cars in the crowd) as he walked by. The parking was really bad, since there was no car service in the plaza - but since he was very big they gave extra space for people to"

This is where it all started.

After the opening of our first location on May 29, we knew it's going to be a long trip for us.

We were looking for something like the one we've been using recently but got instead something that offers a bit of diversity instead.

A place where you can indulge in a wide range of drinks, and where people like you can meet up.

We found out that a good restaurant, where we could have some free coffee and food, also exists that offers brunch, with special drinks like Grog Noodle and a menu that features some of the best American Asian food.

Our goal was $15/night. The only question now is where that money will be going to.

What We Got Back

It was one of the nicest rooms in the town.  We sat close to each other and were laughing as we watched a movie together.

That was pretty hot.

No one knew we were here, nor did they know there was any bad food to be had. 

But it was still a little hot and that was enough for us.. not as big an insult as if we had gone out with someone.

If there's something in the air which seems more like being trapped in a cold tower we'll gladly eat it. ","Started bad; ended bad.

We really tried the neighborhood, it's such little towns, the decor is very nice and clean - there are the cute children playing, the people working and I loved every minute of the experience. In our case our menu was chicken chicken and crab, and we ordered the black cod which we also like quite a little with bacon and red onion.

Very good, if you're like me and want to get your food out to eat at home, but you don't have a house so cheap, this is definitely worth its place. I'm an Italian with an extremely demanding body who loves sweet treats and a good place to get them is with good ol' Sushi! My fiancée is a nurse and he was kind enough to let me in for a tour and was very forthcoming with my meal. I was sure the place was crowded and I was hungry and the servers were extremely pleasant. I ordered a rice pilaf, I chose the very flavorful ponzara, and my 3 pound pork tenderloin had a light hint of chorizo and was just a bit drizzled in with a little bit of chopped onion. So delicious.

Starters like the mussels fragrant... not enough to outweigh the sweetness but it does make everything taste fresh and delicious, while also being a delight to visit with friends and family. The food is flavorful, comforting, salty, good all day at 4. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual, quiet spot up and down the west side of downtown Forrest Hill. Not the most upscale, but the menu is great and they offer everything they mention.

So just take a break from eating and order something you want, that you don't carry in your bag. Thanks, Jeff :)

I have enjoyed many good French restaurants in the area since I was a kid. Their","This unassuming little French restaurant in Forrest Hill is full of surprises. I didn't expect to enjoy my meal so much. Starters like the mussels fragrant... not enough to outweigh the sweetness but it does make everything taste fresh and delicious, while also being a delight to visit with friends and family. The food is flavorful, comforting, salty, good all day at 4. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual, quiet spot up and down the west side of downtown Forrest Hill. Not the most upscale, but the menu is great and they offer everything they mention.

One of this city's best brunch places! My mom bought us a menu from the menu at our friend's place that we are familiar with a very long time ago. Our waitress did an awesome job and kept us busy as we served her our salad on our table. I also noticed very quickly that it wasn't always as good as she had expected. Our server was so attentive that she took our order. The waitstaff was so friendly and she had all-night delicious food. We love our food service, and we will definitely have more to come back to.

This place is legit, just the right pace of food (there's one person in line, it's fine). I ordered a steak tartare and I ordered the french onion soup that I had on hand. The broth was decent, but my meat was already cold (only one part of his beef). It was nice that the onion soup was frozen. We were pleasantly surprised with how well the meal ran. It was also good that after all the salad came out, we didn't need anything. I don't know how much they made this salad, but I'm going to go back if I wanna try it again.

Not sure how amazing this little island is, but it does look so nice. At least I enjoy taking some pictures! I am looking forward to having lunch with my friends!!

Came here one night the night before the weekend and got my order and was pleasantly surprised at the quality and quality of things I had with the food. I've never been to a place like this before and it was absolutely breathtaking (but with the added bonus of being so small). The food was amazing. The service was prompt and I was also completely impressed by the menu which I've been trying out and really like.

It's difficult... to me, I'm not sure if we're truly trying to be ""authentic"" or if the food is simply out of touch with American tastes. But honestly I felt completely at home with a few of my friends coming and tasting the wines, my food choices weren't anything special but, I'll bet, a lot more sophisticated than the way the people of the United States enjoy that wine. 

And I'm not going to lie here. There was some magic in this whole experience. 

The food was amazing. 

After spending my entire day with my dad, we tried out the wine. It's an incredible piece of food, to not only taste, the aroma is incredible, and I can easily attest to how very special it is.

Our server was pleasant and... nice to be with. Just... quiet. You know, that's never a good idea, I think, given that we have a big group and the server is all about that, you know what I'm saying? Because I think we need a little more freedom, you know? A little less of this sort of chatter. Just a little less of the actual talking, and at least that's what I like.

In that day it felt like it was our normal hours and nights for dinner. There was lots of talk and lots of jokes. I mean, I am really impressed by this room, and by the variety of recipes and the variety of the people I have and the variety of the ingredients, and the variety of flavors and ingredients.

And the food has been phenomenal. As you get older, you probably know more","We were here for lunch, so not quite as intimate as it may seem in the evening. That's okay, because we were here with a group.

Fancy Italian Restaurant (MILWAUKEE) One of the best casual Italian restaurants in the Milwaukee area, this restaurant provides everything all the time. Their menu includes homemade Italian dishes with vegetarian, vegan and fruit dishes - perfect for a party. You can still get the seafood, chicken or pasta combo. They also do their breakfast-menu. Serves 4 people, including 12 and up. Come here and get it from one of our many locations.

We love this place! We go here daily. I'm gonna be honest, the only thing i've eaten here besides the grilled cheese is the cheese. If I had the chance, but not the money to do it, it would probably just be me and my parents - so don't give them any credit.

The only people who truly live up to the hype and hype, I believe, are some of the most dedicated people in America -- the young entrepreneurs, the entrepreneurs out there who love San Francisco and the people to whom they want to follow -- and you're going to need a lot of people you can trust and love to keep you going into the future. You're going to miss out.

And you'll miss out on an important source of income for the city, the way money can buy good jobs, good people, nice homes -- those kinds of things.

Great place to begin working out. My kids will make us drink cold tequila if they get ready. My 4 year old is a really good athlete and he loves to play soccer. You can order cold tequila if he likes it. My wife and I made this for our son at home, we loved it. The flavor was amazing and did not overpower anything. We will return. The place also seemed to have a big beer hang-out with some nice local wine, but we were not able to give it a go. I think it could be better but we have been to other states and we would agree.

I first came here in 2021 and ordered the award winning... I didn't give it to them for $20 or anything but here they are.... This place is incredible. There's something to be said for having one of the best food in Vietnam. You will see it all over the place. There is absolutely nothing to think about or don't know about but you will definitely come if you really want to try this place and do your own thing. Also, you can go to the restaurant for dinner at the end of the day or even if you're in Viet Nam. My only complaint is the food is pretty shitty. I think this place is terrible if you stay late but not during this time of year. It is really very good but it just makes things less enjoyable. It's really nice and comfortable, which is good because you don't have to bring a bottle every time.","A nice bartender at Pat O'Brien's recommended to go to Vyoone's so we had to add it to our trip.

The courses were in perfect sequence.,5,New Orleans,"Probably the best dining experience of my life! The food was extraordinary. The service was world class. The courses were in perfect sequence. I ordered a huge selection of traditional and exotic fish as my special. The shrimp was very good, but really lacked the marigana quality. We ended up only having two of the best shrimp that we had, and it was all very good. We were extremely disappointed. For the price, it can't beat that. I would say that the shrimp was a disappointment. I got two of those shrimp - the only real shrimp that was really good. The steak was over priced and it was overcooked. The cheese wasn't great - and it tasted kind of like chomped bread. I do like the fries but they are too weak. The chicken was very good but was really short. However, I would say they are a good choice as well. I also order the specials as they are usually very good","Probably the best dining experience of my life! The food was extraordinary.

We had the balsamic vinegar on a roll. It seemed like you had to place the salad in the bowl you cooked it. You have to do both because then every half-cup of spinach will get a full bowl of salad and you have a lot of food in the bowl.

Loved the lyonnaise salad and the pate en croute to start. The lardons on the salad were so... very good, they really worked and reminded me a bit of Italian. 

This place has great value for money and food service. Not a great place but it is a great place!!! Thanks again!!!!

We had the balsamic vinegar on a roll. It seemed like you had to place the salad in the bowl you cooked it. You have to do both because then every half-cup of spinach will get a full bowl of salad and you have a lot of food in the bowl. 

This place had a great wine and champagne and this is what you get when you work at the mall. The patio was lovely and you can see at lunchtime the patio area has a fountain that looks like a beach so there's not that much more to it. Plus there's all"

We were lucky enough to have him in the restaurant during our first stop in Austin to share everything about him.

This family picnic was so delicious and we thought it was great to offer it to the kids as part of our family holiday celebration. We knew that if we did this we would not only have many more guests to try, but we would also have more to offer our guests.

It's going to be a nice change from the cheap buffet fare.

I'm a huge fan of the Seafood menu: the chicken, beef and seafood with the dressing and sauces. I wanted to check it out because I was surprised at the quality that I got for tasting.

Awesome service, great atmosphere, great food, and a few nice little places to get your food on the day after it's served! We had a salad and a nice appetizer too, so good that we decided to try it. Service was great too. The food was perfect, and the food was worth the wait. The place was pretty small, no big room. The service could have been better!","Really loved this place!

Our waitress took care to give us a good order before we left at lunch and it was very good!!! We took the day off from work on Thursday. We had a good time getting around the city during the week. We were there for 2 weeks and had 3 drinks at the time. We got to stay at a friend of ours who runs the place and we are on top of this.

Awesome service, great atmosphere, great food, and a few nice little places to get your food on the day after it's served! We had a salad and a nice appetizer too, so good that we decided to try it. Service was great too. The food was perfect, and the food was worth the wait. The place was pretty small, no big room. The service could have been better!"

It was the first time I've visited one of the most beloved restaurants in the area and it was one of the reasons I love to visit their bizzaro, bicchio. The food was absolutely unbelievable. I am so happy they chose to serve this dish. It was so good! I'm usually shy before having dinner in private, but this was wonderful. Definitely recommended!!!

Amazing experience. Was so glad to be at St. Paul's. First time getting my plates when I visited here, there was like 6+ people in the group at any moment to help me with the menu while we were still in school. I was able to get a complimentary soda because they had some really delicious beers they weren't supposed to have.

The rest of the service was good. Service: We walked the four miles to San Diego for lunch and it is pretty much the best in town. At that point I decided to order some more meats and vegetables. I was expecting more but I ordered our shrimp fries on a good day (which I could easily have done at home). The shrimp fries were really good but there was a bit of taste for chicken fried and fried egg. The wings and veal meat were quite spicy but they were definitely better than most.

This was one of my favorite spots in the area. I've had many the likes of ""Tender Cream, Big Cheese,"" ""Flat Cheese,"" and more. It just feels so clean, and I've found it's easier to find here on Facebook than anywhere else in the neighborhood for sure.

I'm a fan of the Caffès Cafe. Just as I love Cafe Caffès and the way it creates a cozy atmosphere on every one of the four sides of the restaurant. So amazing and the place was the perfect fit. A great spot for all your summer fun!

You'll find a lot of things... but it's a little more... well, more like a pretty thing or something. Oh, also it looks pretty big. I have to say, it's pretty. 

I've gotten a lot of emails just expressing how excited these hotels are because we could be on top of"

I was always very impressed with this location. The menu is simple and fun. We ordered the steak & egg frites which was good. Service was excellent and always great. I will definitely recommend to people of any age. Read more Read

The restaurant is great but I'd never try anything in NYC! The food has that much flavor I've been missing for so long. I had the chicken curry sandwich, and that was the main attraction of the experience. The only downside is the food is quite expensive! The beef is on the left side of me and my side of the pizza. It's in half size though, and all of your pizza was fine.

It is not the most popular place with the people, but overall a well made restaurant with an amazing atmosphere and a great selection. We recommend them over the others. All the tables close in first, so everyone, as well in the front. My friends and I were really happy we got to try their food for the first time to try it out over dinner-it was delicious.

As an avid music fan and always wanting to hear a song like a French fusion or jazz fusion or a classic dance party where the two of us could watch a live band to get a little extra experience.. this restaurant was really special!! They have so many different ways to choose your entrée to go with it! So we spent hours making everything our own and came up with what we ended up with!! I wish you all the best! My friends recommended this place!!

This is my favorite dining and a treat for any family and friends alike. This is one of the top places for French toast from your family or friends. It's a very traditional French place and so delicious. There's a place that will always be there for you. It's just so unique and it never fails to be a treat","Pricey, classy, and buttery, lol.

...a very special paper for Christmas and the first day of a week for the family. 

Very informative, very very polite...even while we were still asleep to say anything.

The paper we received came with the names on it that you may have seen from other newspapers and was a beautiful piece of paper and was a very nice piece of paper. 

The children's room was lovely. We got a big treat every Thursday from the paper. 

On the other hand, we all just hated the paper and were very sad that Christmas became a holiday.

And I did. You did a great job. In the end, it was just just a nice day. After the show is over, I will be back and make my way to the club. I'll see you there.

The Pithivier was out of this world! The overall dining experience, including the the service and the ambiance was exceptional....The food was simply magnificent. I recommend getting a dinner reservation today for this restaurant. I would definitely recommend this for anyone seeking a quick meal out of San Francisco.

I am a HUGE fan of San Francisco food so I have come here more than once. So far we've been impressed and it's taken our trip quite a while so I decided to revisit. First and foremost we ordered a plate of Chicken Tikka Masala which was quite tasty. The curry is definitely top notch as well we ordered a curry plate of Indian Ganesana which was really good too! What is better is that we got a nice selection of Asian and Western foods that were very well served. The service was decent and the staff was nice but my only complaint would be my server who is a hard worker would be too busy working and would end up in the middle of the line.

Overall... I'm a very satisfied customer... I would like to go back for more of this dish. 
I came from Northampton at such a young age! I would not go back!! I didn't take the recipe out of the ingredients, so it was only a half a plate or so and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had cooked all way through. 
It is just so great - good flavor and slightly tangy! The only downside is not quite as spicy as I said. I think it has an unpleasant tang, because it isn't the kind of tang that's supposed to be present in our kitchen. 
What I'm saying is that as a long time chef, I find it's really just too hard to find something that gets my liking.
